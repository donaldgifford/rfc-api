## Question

For every heading in the rfc-api corpus, does the `section_slug` value emitted by `internal/search/meilisearch/section.go:slugify` equal the slug that `rehype-slug` (via `github-slugger`) would produce for the same heading text?

If not — for which classes of headings do they diverge, and what is the cheapest path to a CI-enforced contract: port `github-slugger` to Go, drive a Node sidecar, or relax the contract on one side?

## Hypothesis

**They agree on simple ASCII headings but diverge in at least three ways:**

1. **Unicode letters** — rfc-api's `nonSlugRune = [^a-z0-9]+` strips *every* non-ASCII letter. `github-slugger` lowercases via Unicode case-folding and preserves Unicode letters/digits via `[^\p{L}\p{N}_-]`. A heading like `### Café configuration` becomes `caf-configuration` on rfc-api but `café-configuration` on the consumer.
2. **Duplicate-heading collision suffixing** — `github-slugger` is stateful per-document: a second `## Notes` becomes `notes-1`, a third becomes `notes-2`. rfc-api's `slugify` is pure and per-heading; both `## Notes` instances slug to `notes`. Anchor collisions on the rendered side mean `#notes` always scrolls to the first one regardless of which the search hit pointed at.
3. **Inline formatting and HTML in headings** — `## The \`Source\` field` slugs how? rfc-api: `source` is part of the input string after Markdown-fence stripping (need to verify exactly what the goldmark walker passes to `slugify`). rehype-slug operates on rendered text content, which strips backticks but keeps the inner word. Probably aligned but worth pinning down.

I expect issues 1 and 2 to be real divergences, issue 3 to be aligned in practice. Recommendation will likely be **Option A** (port github-slugger to Go) — the algorithm is small, stable, and the test then catches drift on either side.

## Context

`rfc-site` (the SSR Markdown frontend) uses `rehype-slug` to derive heading `id="..."` attributes so intra-document anchor links work. Per `rfc-site/docs/design/0002-markdown-rendering-pipeline.md` §Data Model, the slug applied to a rendered heading **must** equal the `section_slug` field that `rfc-api` returns on `SearchResult` payloads.

Today the contract is implicit. When the two slugifiers diverge — Unicode normalization, collision suffixing, code-span treatment — search-hit deep links silently break: the user clicks a hit, lands on the right document, but `#some-slug` doesn't match any heading id and no scroll happens. We want this contract explicit and CI-enforced before the corpus grows enough to surface the bug organically.

**Triggered by:** [issue #20](https://github.com/donaldgifford/rfc-api/issues/20), `rfc-site/docs/design/0002-markdown-rendering-pipeline.md`.

## Approach

1. **Read both algorithms in full.** Go side: `internal/search/meilisearch/section.go:slugify` (already known — strip `[^a-z0-9]+`, replace with `-`, lowercase, trim). JS side: clone `github-slugger` (the algorithm `rehype-slug` actually delegates to) and read its `slug.js` end-to-end. Document the exact rule set each implements.
2. **Verify what input string each receives.** rfc-api's slugify is called from the goldmark AST walker — confirm whether it sees the rendered heading text (inline backticks stripped) or the raw Markdown source. rehype-slug runs on the HAST after Markdown→HTML transformation, so it sees rendered text.
3. **Build a fixture set.** Cover the categories named in issue #20's acceptance criteria: ASCII, punctuation, Unicode (Latin Extended + CJK + Cyrillic), code-spans in headings, duplicate-heading collisions, leading/trailing punctuation, headings of length 1, headings consisting only of stripped characters. Aim for ~30 cases.
4. **Run both implementations against the fixture set** and tabulate matches vs divergences. Use a small Node script for the JS side (`npx github-slugger`-style); compare against `slugify` from the Go side via a quick test harness.
5. **Decide the path forward.** Three options to weigh in #Recommendation: (A) port github-slugger to Go and route `slugify` through it; (B) drive a Node sidecar from the contract test only — keep the Go slugifier as is; (C) relax the contract on rfc-site (e.g. rfc-site re-derives slugs from the headings it renders, ignores `section_slug`).

## Environment

| Component                         | Version / Value                                              |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| rfc-api `slugify`                 | `internal/search/meilisearch/section.go` (regex `[^a-z0-9]+`)|
| rehype-slug                       | whatever rfc-site pins (verify) — typically 6.x              |
| github-slugger (rehype-slug's dep)| typically 2.x                                                |
| Go                                | 1.26.1                                                       |
| Test corpus                       | rfc-api's own `docs/**/*.md` is a reasonable seed            |

## Findings

### Algorithm A — rfc-api `slugify`

Source: `internal/search/meilisearch/section.go:145`.

```go
var nonSlugRune = regexp.MustCompile(`[^a-z0-9]+`)

func slugify(s string) string {
    s = strings.ToLower(strings.TrimSpace(s))
    s = nonSlugRune.ReplaceAllString(s, "-")
    s = strings.Trim(s, "-")
    return s
}
```

Properties:

- **Keep set:** `[a-z0-9]` only (post-lowercase). Strips every other rune — including underscores and every Unicode letter.
- **Replacement strategy:** runs of stripped chars *and whitespace* collapse to a single `-`.
- **Trim:** leading/trailing `-` removed.
- **Stateless:** no collision tracking; `slugify("Notes")` returns `"notes"` every call.

The input string passed to `slugify` is the AST-flattened heading text (`headingText` at `section.go:98` walks the goldmark inline children and concatenates `*ast.Text` segments — backticks, link wrappers, and emphasis are dropped, but their inner text is kept). So `## The \`Source\` field` arrives at `slugify` as `"The Source field"`.

### Algorithm B — `github-slugger`

Source: [github.com/Flet/github-slugger](https://github.com/Flet/github-slugger), `index.js` + `regex.js`. This is what `rehype-slug` delegates to and what GitHub itself uses for heading anchors.

```js
export function slug(value, maintainCase) {
  if (typeof value !== 'string') return ''
  if (!maintainCase) value = value.toLowerCase()
  return value.replace(STRIP_REGEX, '').replace(/ /g, '-')
}
```

Plus a stateful wrapper class that adds collision suffixing:

```js
slug(value, maintainCase) {
  let result = slug(value, maintainCase === true)
  const originalSlug = result
  while (own.call(self.occurrences, result)) {
    self.occurrences[originalSlug]++
    result = originalSlug + '-' + self.occurrences[originalSlug]
  }
  self.occurrences[result] = 0
  return result
}
```

Properties:

- **Keep set:** `\p{L}` (Unicode letters) + `\p{N}` (Unicode digits) + `_` + `-` + ` ` (single space). Everything else stripped, *not* replaced.
  - The upstream `STRIP_REGEX` is a precomputed enumeration of every Unicode codepoint that isn't in this set. For practical heading content `[^\p{L}\p{N}_\- ]` is faithful — a handful of codepoints in unusual blocks (musical symbols, certain emoji ranges) differ but never appear in real prose.
- **Replacement strategy:** stripped chars are removed (no hyphen substitution). Then *single-space → hyphen*, applied as a separate pass — multiple consecutive spaces become multiple consecutive hyphens, and only `0x20` is treated as space (tabs/NBSP are stripped, not space-converted).
- **Trim:** *none*. A heading like `"  Padded  "` lowercases to `"  padded  "`, no chars stripped, then spaces→hyphens → `"--padded--"`.
- **Stateful:** the `Slugger` class tracks per-document occurrences. Second `## Notes` becomes `notes-1`; third becomes `notes-2`. rehype-slug instantiates one slugger per HAST tree, so the state is per-rendered-document.

### Fixture comparison (synthetic)

26 representative cases. Run via a standalone Go harness that reimplements both algorithms (rfc-api copy verbatim; github-slugger ported using `\p{L}\p{N}` for the keep set). All 26 outcomes matched the prior hypothesis — no surprise mismatches.

| 2nd | `Notes` | `notes` | `notes-1` |
| 3rd | `Notes` | `notes` | `notes-2` |

### Fixture comparison (real corpus)

Scanned every `.md` file under `docs/` in this repo (skipping fenced code blocks). 355 H1–H6 headings extracted. Comparison run between `rfc-api slugify` and the faithful github-slugger port:

- **26 of 355 headings (7.3%) diverge** on a single-call basis.
- **38 additional divergences from collision suffixing** — that's the count of duplicate-headings-within-a-doc tuples; each one corresponds to a slug that github-slugger would suffix (`-1`, `-2`, …) but rfc-api emits identically.
- **Total: 64 of 355 (18.0%) of the live corpus** would deep-link incorrectly today.

Examples from the live corpus:

```
design/0001-…/      "OpenAPI / contract management"
                    rfc-api  = "openapi-contract-management"
                    gh       = "openapi--contract-management"   (space-slash-space → "--")

development/local-dev.md  "Postgres won't come up clean after schema changes"
                          rfc-api = "postgres-won-t-come-up-clean-after-schema-changes"
                          gh      = "postgres-wont-come-up-clean-after-schema-changes"

investigation/0001-…  "`rfd-api` — what it actually does"
                      rfc-api = "rfd-api-what-it-actually-does"
                      gh      = "rfd-api--what-it-actually-does"   (em dash stripped between two spaces)

impl/0002-…  "Phase 3: store.Docs Postgres implementation"
             rfc-api = "phase-3-store-docs-postgres-implementation"
             gh      = "phase-3-storedocs-postgres-implementation"
```

Three patterns dominate the live divergences:

1. **`X / Y` separators** in headings — extremely common (`API / Interface Changes`, `Migration / Rollout Plan`, `OpenAPI / contract management`). rfc-api emits a single hyphen; github-slugger emits two.
2. **Apostrophes in casual prose** — `won't`, `can't`, `it's`. rfc-api hyphenates around them; github-slugger drops them.
3. **Em dashes** in mid-heading parentheticals — heavily used in this corpus (`— what it actually does`).

Plus the universal **collision-suffix** divergence: 38 events across the corpus where the same H2 text appears more than once within a document.

### Side effect: indexer sub-doc id collisions

This investigation surfaced a related live bug on the indexer side. Sub-document ids in Meilisearch are constructed as `{parent_id}__{section_slug}` (`section.go` + `indexer.go`). When the same H2 text appears twice in a document — e.g. `## API / Interface Changes` in both DESIGN-0001 and DESIGN-0002 — the rfc-api slugifier produces the same slug, but those are *different parent_ids*, so no collision in that case. **However,** when the same H2 appears twice *within* one document, the second section's Meili upsert overwrites the first (same `{parent}__{slug}` key). Today this is masked because the corpus rarely has intra-doc duplicate H2s; once it does, search hits silently lose half the section content. github-slugger's collision suffix makes this safe by construction.

## Conclusion

**Answer: Yes, they diverge significantly.** rfc-api's current `slugify` and github-slugger / rehype-slug agree on simple ASCII-only prose with no Unicode letters, no underscores, no apostrophes, no inner em-dashes, no `X / Y` separators, and no duplicate H2s. They diverge on every other class of heading.

Concretely on the live rfc-api corpus today: **18% of headings already produce a broken deep-link** from search results, with the majority coming from collision suffixing and the `X / Y` separator pattern. As the corpus grows and includes more international content (ADR-0003 #Search expects this) the divergence rate climbs.

The contract that issue #20 wants explicit + CI-enforced is currently **violated, not just implicit.**

## Recommendation

**Option A — port github-slugger to Go inside `internal/search/meilisearch/section.go`.** Replace the existing `slugify` with a faithful Go port using Go's native `\p{L}\p{N}` Unicode classes (Go's `regexp` supports them out of the box, unlike older JS engines, so we don't need the giant precomputed Unicode block list — `\p{L}\p{N}` is functionally equivalent for practical heading text). Add a stateful slugger threaded per-document through the indexer to handle collision suffixing.

Sketch:

```go
var nonSlugRune = regexp.MustCompile(`[^\p{L}\p{N}_\- ]`)

// pure, stateless — for callers that want raw github-slugger semantics.
func slug(s string) string {
    s = strings.ToLower(s)
    s = nonSlugRune.ReplaceAllString(s, "")
    s = strings.ReplaceAll(s, " ", "-")
    return s
}

// slugger is per-document; tracks occurrences for collision suffixing.
type slugger struct{ seen map[string]int }

func newSlugger() *slugger { return &slugger{seen: map[string]int{}} }

func (g *slugger) slug(s string) string {
    base := slug(s)
    result := base
    for {
        if _, exists := g.seen[result]; !exists {
            break
        }
        g.seen[base]++
        result = fmt.Sprintf("%s-%d", base, g.seen[base])
    }
    g.seen[result] = 0
    return result
}
```

Wire `splitSections` to instantiate a `*slugger` per document and call `g.slug(headingText(...))` instead of the package-level `slugify`. Keep the package-level pure `slug` function for tests + callers that don't need state.

Then satisfy issue #20's acceptance criteria with a contract test in `test/contract/` that:

1. Generates a fixture set covering the categories in #Approach step 3 (ASCII / punctuation / Unicode / code-spans / collisions / leading-trailing / length-1 / all-stripped). The existing `/tmp/slug-compare` harness is the seed — fold its fixtures in, expand to ~50 cases.
2. Asserts `slug(input) == expected` for each case.
3. Optionally — and this is what makes it a true *contract* test against the consumer — vendors a snapshot of `github-slugger`'s actual output (run once via `npx github-slugger`, committed as a JSON fixture) and asserts the Go port matches byte-for-byte. CI re-runs the Go port; rfc-site CI separately re-runs npx-github-slugger against the same fixture file. Drift on either side fails immediately.

**Why not Option B (Node sidecar in tests):** adds Node to the rfc-api test environment. We have no other Node dependency in this repo and don't want to introduce one for a 30-LoC algorithm. The "snapshot fixture from a one-time npx run" pattern in step 3 above gets the same accuracy guarantee without the runtime Node coupling.

**Why not Option C (relax the contract; rfc-site re-derives slugs):** a per-search-hit re-slug operation on the consumer side adds CPU per page render and pushes the contract responsibility outward to every consumer (MCP server, future CLI, anything else). The whole point of `section_slug` in the API payload is "the producer has already authoritatively slugified this — render it as the heading anchor and link to it." Relaxing means the field has no use, and we'd remove it from the API instead.

**Migration concerns:** changing the slug algorithm means existing Meili sub-doc ids invalidate. Need a `make reindex --check-drift` pass after the change lands; the existing `cmd/rfc-api/reindex.go` infrastructure handles this. Document in the IMPL doc that lands the fix.

**Follow-up scope (not this investigation):**

- Open a follow-up issue / IMPL for the actual implementation + contract test.
- Coordinate the rollout with rfc-site so it bumps the rfc-api OpenAPI pin and regenerates types in the same window — though no OpenAPI shape changes here, just the runtime values.
